Actually, the simpler solution is to **remove the `vercel.json` file entirely** and make sure your file structure is correct. Vercel should automatically serve:

- `index.html` → `https://vanillasometh.in/`
- `contact/page.html` → `https://vanillasometh.in/contact/page.html`

But you want it to be accessible at `https://vanillasometh.in/contact` (without `/page.html`).

**The fix is to rename your files:**

Rename each `page.html` to `index.html` inside its folder:
```
/contact/index.html  (instead of contact/page.html)
/estimator/index.html  (instead of estimator/page.html)
/project-showcase/index.html  (instead of project-showcase/page.html)
