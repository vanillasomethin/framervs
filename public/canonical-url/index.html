      <h1>Specify a Canonical URL for Duplicate or Similar Pages</h1>
      <p>
        To specify a canonical URL for duplicate or very similar pages to Google Search, you
        can indicate your preference using a number of methods. These are, in order of how
        strongly they can influence canonicalization:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Redirects:</strong> A strong signal that the target of the redirect should
          become canonical.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>rel=&quot;canonical&quot; link annotations:</strong> A strong signal that
          the specified URL should become canonical.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sitemap inclusion:</strong> A weak signal that helps the URLs that are
          included in a sitemap become canonical.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that these methods can stack and thus become more effective when
        combined. This means that when you use two or more of the methods, that will increase
        the chance of your preferred canonical URL appearing in search results.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we encourage you to use these methods, none of them are required; your site will
        likely do just fine without specifying a canonical preference. That&apos;s because if
        you don&apos;t specify a canonical URL, Google will identify which version of the URL
        is objectively the best version to show to users in Search.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you use a CMS, such as WordPress, Wix, or Blogger, you might not be able to edit
        your HTML directly. Instead, your CMS might have a search engine settings page or some
        other mechanism to tell search engines about the canonical URL. Search for
        instructions about modifying the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your page on your CMS
        (for example, search for &quot;wordpress set the canonical element&quot;).
      </p>

      <h2>Reasons to specify a canonical URL</h2>
      <p class="note">This resource may not be available in your region.</p>
      <p>
        While it&apos;s generally not critical to specify a canonical preference for your
        URLs, there are a number of reasons why you would want to explicitly tell Google about
        a canonical page in a set of duplicate or similar pages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To specify which URL that you want people to see in search results. You might prefer
          people to reach your green dress product page through
          <code>https://www.example.com/dresses/green/green-dress.html</code> rather than
          <code>https://example.com/dresses/cocktail?gclid=ABCD</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          To consolidate signals for similar or duplicate pages. It helps search engines to
          be able to consolidate the signals they have for the individual URLs (such as links
          to them) into a single, preferred URL. This means that signals from other sites to
          <code>https://example.com/dresses/cocktail?gclid=ABCD</code> get consolidated with
          links to <code>https://www.example.com/dresses/green/green-dress.html</code> if the
          latter becomes canonical.
        </li>
        <li>
          To simplify tracking metrics for a piece of content. With a variety of URLs, it can
          be more challenging for you to get consolidated metrics for a specific piece of
          content.
        </li>
        <li>
          To avoid spending crawling time on duplicate pages. You may want Googlebot to get
          the most out of your site, so it&apos;s better for it to spend time crawling new (or
          updated) pages on your site, rather than crawling duplicate versions of the same
          content.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Best practices</h2>
      <p>For all canonicalization methods, follow these best practices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Don&apos;t use the robots.txt file for canonicalization purposes.</li>
        <li>
          Don&apos;t use the URL removal tool for canonicalization. It hides all versions of a
          URL from Search.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don&apos;t specify different URLs as canonical for the same page using different
          canonicalization techniques (for example, don&apos;t specify one URL in a sitemap,
          but a different URL for that same page using rel=&quot;canonical&quot;).
        </li>
        <li>Don&apos;t specify a URL fragment as canonical, as Google generally doesn&apos;t support URL fragments.</li>
        <li>
          We don&apos;t recommend using noindex to prevent selection of a canonical page within
          a single site, because it will completely block the page from Search. rel=&quot;canonical&quot;
          link annotations are the preferred solution.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you&apos;re using hreflang elements, make sure to specify a canonical page in the
          same language, or the best possible substitute language if a canonical page doesn&apos;t
          exist for the same language.
        </li>
        <li>
          When linking within your site, link to the canonical URL rather than a duplicate
          URL. Linking consistently to the URL that you consider to be canonical helps Google
          understand your preference.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you&apos;re using client-side rendering with JavaScript, it&apos;s important to
          make sure that the information about the canonical URL is as clear as possible. The
          best way to do this is to specify the canonical URL in the HTML source code and make
          sure that JavaScript doesn&apos;t change the canonical link element. If you can&apos;t
          set the canonical URL in the HTML source code, leave it out and only set it with
          JavaScript. This ensures that the information about the canonical URL is as clear as
          possible.
        </li>
      </ul>

              change often. Only works for HTML pages, not for files such as PDF. In such
              cases, you can use the rel=&quot;canonical&quot; HTTP header.

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>Use rel=&quot;canonical&quot; link annotations</h2>
      <p>
        Google supports explicit rel canonical link annotations as described in RFC 6596.
        rel=&quot;canonical&quot; annotations that suggest alternate versions of a page are
        ignored; specifically, rel=&quot;canonical&quot; annotations with hreflang, lang,
        media, and type attributes are not used for canonicalization. Instead, use the
        appropriate link annotations to specify alternate versions of a page; for example,
        link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; hreflang for language and country annotations.
      </p>

      <h3>The rel=&quot;canonical&quot; link element</h3>
      <p>
        A rel=&quot;canonical&quot; link element (also known as a canonical element) is an
        element used in the head section of HTML to indicate that another page is representative
        of the content on the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose you want <code>https://example.com/dresses/green-dresses</code> to be the
        canonical URL, even though a variety of URLs can access this content. Indicate this URL
        as canonical with these steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Add a link element with the attribute rel=&quot;canonical&quot; to the head section of duplicate pages.</li>
      </ol>
      <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Explore the world of dresses&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;canonical&quot; href=&quot;https://example.com/dresses/green-dresses&quot; /&gt;
&lt;!-- other elements --&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;!-- rest of the HTML --&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>
        If the canonical page has a mobile variant on a separate URL, add a rel=&quot;alternate&quot;
        link element to it, pointing to the mobile version of the page:
      </p>
      <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Explore the world of dresses&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; media=&quot;only screen and (max-width: 640px)&quot; href=&quot;https://m.example.com/dresses/green-dresses&quot;&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;canonical&quot; href=&quot;https://example.com/dresses/green-dresses&quot; /&gt;
&lt;!-- other elements --&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;!-- rest of the HTML --&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>
        Use absolute paths rather than relative paths with the rel=&quot;canonical&quot; link
        element. Even though relative paths are supported by Google, they can cause problems in
        the long run (for example, if you unintentionally allow your testing site to be crawled)
        and thus we don&apos;t recommend them.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Good example: <code>https://www.example.com/dresses/green/green-dress.html</code></li>
        <li>Bad example: <code>/dresses/green/green-dress.html</code></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The rel=&quot;canonical&quot; HTTP header</h3>
      <p>
        If you can change the configuration of your server, you can use a link HTTP response
        header with a rel=&quot;canonical&quot; target attribute as defined by RFC5988 rather
        than an HTML element to indicate the canonical URL for a document supported by Search,
        including non-HTML documents such as PDF files.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you publish content in many file formats, such as PDF or Microsoft Word, each on
        their own URL, you can return a rel=&quot;canonical&quot; HTTP header to tell Googlebot
        what is the canonical URL for the non-HTML files.
      </p>
      <pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 19
...
Link: &lt;https://www.example.com/downloads/white-paper.pdf&gt;; rel=&quot;canonical&quot;
...</code></pre>

      <h2>Use a sitemap</h2>
      <p>
        Pick a canonical URL for each of your pages and submit them in a sitemap. All pages
        listed in a sitemap are suggested as canonicals; Google will decide which pages (if
        any) are duplicates, based on similarity of content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Supplying the preferred canonical URLs in the sitemaps is a simple way of defining
        canonicals for a large site, and sitemaps are a useful way to tell Google which pages
        you consider most important on your site.
      </p>

      <h2>Use redirects</h2>
      <p>
        Use this method when you want to get rid of existing duplicate pages. All redirection
        methods — 301 and 302 redirects, meta-refresh, JavaScript redirects — have the same
        effect on Google Search, however the time it takes for search engines to notice the
        different redirect methods may differ.
      </p>
      <p>For the quickest effect, use 3xx HTTP (also known as server-side) redirects.</p>
      <p>
        Suppose your page can be reached in multiple ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>https://example.com/home</code></li>
        <li><code>https://home.example.com</code></li>
        <li><code>https://www.example.com</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Pick one of those URLs as your canonical URL, and use redirects to send traffic from
        the other URLs to your preferred URL.
      </p>

      <h2>Other signals</h2>
      <p>
        Apart from explicitly provided methods, Google also uses a set of canonicalization
        signals that are generally based on site setup: preferring HTTPS over HTTP, and URLs in
        hreflang clusters.
      </p>

      <h3>Prefer HTTPS over HTTP for canonical URLs</h3>
      <p>
        Google prefers HTTPS pages over equivalent HTTP pages as canonical, except when there
        are issues or conflicting signals such as the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The HTTPS page has an invalid SSL certificate.</li>
        <li>The HTTPS page contains insecure dependencies (other than images).</li>
        <li>The HTTPS page redirects users to or through an HTTP page.</li>
        <li>The HTTPS page has a rel=&quot;canonical&quot; link to the HTTP page.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Although our systems prefer HTTPS pages over HTTP pages by default, you can ensure
        this behavior by taking any of the following actions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Add redirects from the HTTP page to the HTTPS page.</li>
        <li>Add a rel=&quot;canonical&quot; link from the HTTP page to the HTTPS page.</li>
        <li>Implement HSTS.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To prevent Google from incorrectly making the HTTP page canonical, avoid the following practices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid bad TLS/SSL certificates and HTTPS-to-HTTP redirects because they cause Google to prefer HTTP very strongly.</li>
        <li>Don&apos;t include the HTTP version of your pages in your sitemap or hreflang annotations rather than the HTTPS version.</li>
        <li>Ensure your SSL/TLS certificate matches your complete site URL, or use a wildcard certificate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Prefer URLs in hreflang clusters</h3>
      <p>
        To help with sites&apos; localization efforts, for canonicalization purposes Google
        prefers URLs that are part of hreflang clusters. For example, if
        <code>https://example.com/de-de/cats</code> and
        <code>https://example.com/de-ch/cats</code> reciprocally point to each other with
        hreflang annotations, but not to <code>https://example.com/de-at/cats</code>, the
        pages for de-de and de-ch will be preferred as canonicals instead of the /de-at/ page
        that doesn&apos;t appear in the hreflang cluster.
